    "# Polynomial Regression\n",

    "Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y,\n",
    "\n",
    "Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "Conveniently, these models are all linear from the point of view of estimation, since the regression function is linear in terms of the unknown parameters β0, β1, .... Therefore, for least squares analysis, the computational and inferential problems of polynomial regression can be completely addressed using the techniques of multiple regression. This is done by treating x, x2, ... as being distinct independent variables in a multiple regression mode\n",
