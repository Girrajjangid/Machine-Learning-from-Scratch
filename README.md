# MachineLearning_Algorithms

> This repository contains examples of popular machine learning algorithms implemented in **Python** with mathematics behind them being explained. Each algorithm has interactive **Jupyter Notebook** demo that allows you to play with training data, algorithms configurations and immediately see the results, charts and predictions **right in your browser**. 

The purpose of this repository is _not_ to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3<sup>rd</sup> party library one-liners _but_ rather to practice implementing these algorithms from **scratch** and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. 

# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning we have a set of training data as an input and a set of labels or **correct answers** for each training set as an output. Then we're training our model (machine learning algorithm parameters) to map the input to the output correctly (to do correct prediction). The ultimate purpose is to find such model parameters that will successfully continue correct _input‚Üíoutput_ mapping (predictions) even for new input examples.

### Regression

In regression problems we do real value predictions. Basically we try to draw a line/plane/n-dimensional plane along the training examples. In regression we deal with continuos as well as decreate data

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that learns from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning identifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.

### Dimentional Reduction

In dimentional reduction we select 'K' features from given 'n' features by using some techniques.

## Prerequisites

#### Installing Python

Make sure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine.

You might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library
to create virtual environments and have Python, `pip` and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their 
versions.

#### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies that are required for the project by running:

## Datasets

The list of datasets that is being used for Jupyter Notebook demos may be found in [DataSet Folder](DataSets).
